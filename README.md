# use-ackee

![Build](https://github.com/electerious/use-ackee/workflows/Build/badge.svg) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/electerious/use-ackee/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/electerious/use-ackee?branch=master)

Use [Ackee](https://github.com/electerious/Ackee) in React.

## Install

```
npm install use-ackee
```

*or*

```
yarn add use-ackee
```

## Usage

Import and call `use-ackee` in a component responsible for the routing or inside your routes. Make sure that only one `use-ackee` hook is actively rendered to avoid redundant records.

```js
useAckee('/current/path', {
	server: 'https://example.com',
	domainId: 'hd11f820-68a1-11e6-8047-79c0c2d9bce0'
}, {
	detailed: false,
	ignoreLocalhost: true,
	ignoreOwnVisits: true
})
```

Ackee will create a new record every time the `pathname` changes. An undefined or empty `pathname` will be skipped. Use `/` for the root instead.

This hook is a no-op on the server for safe usage during server-side rendering.

## API

### Parameters

- `pathname` `{?String}` Current path.
- `environment` `{Object}` An object that contains details about your [Ackee](https://github.com/electerious/Ackee) installation. The `server` property must not end with a slash.
- `opts` `{?Object}` An object of [Ackee options](https://github.com/electerious/ackee-tracker#options).
